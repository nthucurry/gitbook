# Partition
Partitioning is powerful functionality that allows tables, indexes, and index-organized tables to be subdivided into smaller pieces, enabling these database objects to be managed and accessed at a finer level of granularity (粒度). Oracle provides a comprehensive range of partitioning schemes to address every business requirement. Moreover, since it is entirely transparent in SQL statements, partitioning can be used with any application, from packaged OLTP applications to data warehouses.
