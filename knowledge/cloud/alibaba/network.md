- CEN instances
    - CEN instances are basic network resources that are used to create and manage interconnected networks.
    - After you create a CEN instance, you can connect different networks by attaching them to the CEN instance. To connect networks deployed on a global scale, you must **purchase** a bandwidth plan and allocate bandwidth for cross-region connections.
- Network instances
    - Network instances that are attached to a CEN instance can communicate with each other. You can attach the following network instances to a CEN instance: VPCs, virtual border routers (VBRs) and Cloud Connect Network (CCN) instances.
- Bandwidth plans
    - No bandwidth plan is required if you want to connect network instances within the same region. To connect network instances in different regions, you must **purchase** a bandwidth plan for the areas to which the networks belong and allocate bandwidth for cross-region connections. Each area contains one or more Alibaba Cloud regions. You can view the supported areas in the CEN console.
