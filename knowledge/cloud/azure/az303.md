# 1. Implement Azure Active Directory
## AAD
- 每個租戶的 AAD 不可作關聯
- c ?
- PIM 必考

## Azure AD Concepts
- Identity
    - A thing that can get authenticated. An identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities also include applications or other servers that might require authentication through secret keys or certificates.
- Account
    - An identity that has data associated with it. You cannot have an account without an identity.
- Azure AD Account
    - An identity created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365. Identities are stored in Azure AD and accessible to your organization's cloud service subscriptions. This account is also sometimes called a Work or school account.
- Azure subscription
    - Used to pay for Azure cloud services. You can have many subscriptions and they're linked to a credit card.
- Azure tenant
    - A dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD that's automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. An Azure tenant represents a single organization.
- Azure AD directory
    - Each Azure tenant has a dedicated and trusted Azure AD directory. The Azure AD directory includes the tenant's users, groups, and apps and is used to perform identity and access management functions for tenant resources.

## Management Groups
## User Accounts
- New User, New Guest User
- Guest 不需管理帳號密碼 (B2B) --> 學校或工作信箱或非微軟的個人信箱

## Manage Guest Users
## Group Accounts

## Managing Multiple Directories
- 多個 directories
- custom domain, 將 txt, mx 加入本地端的 DNS zone裡面，適用於內部AD同步

## Azure B2B and B2C
## Domains and Custom Domains
## Azure AD Conditional Access
## Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

## Azure Active Directory Identity Protection (AIP)
- P2 才適用

## MFA
- 不需要有AAD ，即可使用
- 啟用 & 強制使用
- Guest 也可以使用
- CAL: by user, by signed count

# 2. Implement and Manage Hybrid Identities
## Azure AD Connect
Integrating your on-premises directories with AAD makes your users more productive by providing a common identity for accessing both cloud and on-premises resources. Users and organizations can take advantage of:
- Users can use a single identity to access on-premises applications and cloud services such as Microsoft 365.
- Single tool to provide an easy deployment experience for synchronization and sign-in.
- Provides the **newest capabilities** for your scenarios. AAD Connect replaces older versions of identity integration tools such as DirSync and Azure AD Sync.

## Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync
AAD Connect cloud sync is new offering from Microsoft designed to meet and accomplish your hybrid identity goals for synchronization of users, groups and contacts to Azure AD. It accomplishes this by **using the AAD cloud provisioning agent** instead of the Azure AD Connect application.
<br><img src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/media/concept-how-it-works/how-1.png" width=500>

## Azure AD Connect Installation
## Hybrid Identity with AAD
- Password hash synchronization (PHS)
- Pass-through authentication (PTA)
- Federation (AD FS)

## Authentication Options
- Password hash synchronization
    - A sign-in method that **synchronizes a hash of a users on-premises AD password** with AAD.
- Pass-through authentication
    - A sign-in method that allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud, but doesn't require the additional infrastructure of a federated environment.
- Federation integration
    - Federation is an optional part of AAD Connect and can be used to configure a hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure. It also provides AD FS management capabilities such as certificate renewal (更新) and additional AD FS server deployments.

## Single Sign-On
## Self-Service Password Reset
## Azure AD Health Overview

# 3. Implement Virtual Networking
## Azure Virtual Networking
- Communicate between Azure resources
    - Through a VNet
    - Through a VNet service endpoint
    - Through VNet Peering
    - Through Private Link
- Communicate with on-premises resources
    - Point-to-site virtual private network (P2S VPN)
    - Site-to-site VPN (S2S VPN)
    - Azure ExpressRoute (專線，台灣為是方電訊)
- Filter network traffic
    - Network Security groups (NSGs)
    - Network virtual appliances (NVA)
        - A network virtual appliance (NVA) is a VM that performs a network function, such as a firewall, WAN optimization, or other network function.
- Route network traffic
    - Route tables
    - Border gateway protocol (BGP) routes
        - If you connect your virtual network to your on-premises network using an Azure **VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute** connection, you can propagate your on-premises BGP routes to your virtual networks.

## Connect Services with Virtual Network Peering
- Configure VNet Peering

## Gateway Transit and Transitivity
## Service Chaining
## Vnet Peering vs VPN Gateway
## Considerations

# 4. Implement VMs for Windows and Linux
## Virtual Machine Sizes
## Virtual Machine Pricing
## Virtual Machine Storage
Managed disks are the newer and recommended disk storage model. Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines. Managed disks are like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized. With managed disks, all you have to do is specify the disk size, the disk type, and provision the disk.

## Availability Sets & Zones

# 13. Implement Container-Based Applications
## Azure Container Instances
ACI offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage any VMs and without having to adopt a higher-level service.

ACI is a great solution for any scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.

## Container Groups
The top-level resource in ACI is the container group. A container group is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine. The containers in a container group share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes. It's similar in concept to a pod in K8S.

<br><img src="https://rajanieshkaushikk.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/container.jpg">

## ACR (補充)
- IaaS
- 只能由 docker cmd 操作

## Azure Kubernetes Service
AKS manages your hosted K8S environment and makes it simple to deploy and manage containerized applications in Azure. Your AKS environment is enabled with features such as automated updates, self-healing, and easy scaling. The Kubernetes cluster master is managed by Azure and is free. **You manage the agent nodes in the cluster** and only pay for the VMs on which your nodes run.

- 多個 ACI 集合體
- Pools are groups of nodes with identical configurations.
- Nodes are individual VMs running containerized applications.
- Pods are a single instance of an application. A pod can contain multiple containers.
- Container is a lightweight and portable executable image that contains software and all of its dependencies.
- Deployment has one or more identical pods managed by Kubernetes.
- Manifest is the YAML file describing a deployment.

# 14. Implement an Application Infrastructure
## Azure App Service Overview
Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

## Deployment slots
Using the Azure portal, you can easily add deployment slots to an App Service web app. For instance, you can create a staging deployment slot where you can push your code to test on Azure. Once you are happy with your code, you can easily swap the staging deployment slot with the production slot. You do all this with a few simple mouse clicks in the Azure portal.

## Continuous integration/deployment support
The Azure portal provides out-of-the-box (開箱即用) continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your development machine. Connect your web app with any of the above sources and App Service will do the rest for you by automatically syncing your code and any future changes on the code into the web app.

## Azure Container Registry
ACR is that you can use to create your own private Docker registries to store Docker images in the cloud, in an storage account. Like Docker Hub, ACR is organized around repositories that contain one or more images. ACR also lets you automate tasks such as redeploying an app when an image is rebuilt.

## Azure App Service Plans
An App Service plan is a set of virtual server resources that run App Service apps. A plan's size (sku or pricing tier) determines the performance characteristics of the virtual servers that run the apps assigned to the plan and the App Service features that those apps have access to. Every App Service web app you create must be assigned to a single App Service plan that runs it.
