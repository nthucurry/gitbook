# 1. Implement Azure Active Directory
## AAD
- 每個租戶的 AAD 不可作關聯
- c ?
- PIM 必考

## Azure AD Concepts
- Identity
    - A thing that can get authenticated. An identity can be a user with a username and password. Identities also include applications or other servers that might require authentication through secret keys or certificates.
- Account
    - An identity that has data associated with it. You cannot have an account without an identity.
- Azure AD Account
    - An identity created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365. Identities are stored in Azure AD and accessible to your organization's cloud service subscriptions. This account is also sometimes called a Work or school account.
- Azure subscription
    - Used to pay for Azure cloud services. You can have many subscriptions and they're linked to a credit card.
- Azure tenant
    - A dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD that's automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription, such as Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft 365. An Azure tenant represents a single organization.
- Azure AD directory
    - Each Azure tenant has a dedicated and trusted Azure AD directory. The Azure AD directory includes the tenant's users, groups, and apps and is used to perform identity and access management functions for tenant resources.

## Management Groups
## User Accounts
- New User, New Guest User
- Guest 不需管理帳號密碼 (B2B) --> 學校或工作信箱或非微軟的個人信箱

## Manage Guest Users
## Group Accounts

## Managing Multiple Directories
- 多個 directories
- custom domain, 將 txt, mx 加入本地端的 DNS zone裡面，適用於內部AD同步

## Azure B2B and B2C
## Domains and Custom Domains
## Azure AD Conditional Access
## Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

## Azure Active Directory Identity Protection (AIP)
- P2 才適用

## MFA
- 不需要有AAD ，即可使用
- 啟用 & 強制使用
- Guest 也可以使用
- CAL: by user, by signed count

# 2. Implement and Manage Hybrid Identities
## Azure AD Connect
Integrating your on-premises directories with AAD makes your users more productive by providing a common identity for accessing both cloud and on-premises resources. Users and organizations can take advantage of:
- Users can use a single identity to access on-premises applications and cloud services such as Microsoft 365.
- Single tool to provide an easy deployment experience for synchronization and sign-in.
- Provides the **newest capabilities** for your scenarios. AAD Connect replaces older versions of identity integration tools such as DirSync and Azure AD Sync.

## Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync
AAD Connect cloud sync is new offering from Microsoft designed to meet and accomplish your hybrid identity goals for synchronization of users, groups and contacts to Azure AD. It accomplishes this by **using the AAD cloud provisioning agent** instead of the Azure AD Connect application.

## Azure AD Connect Installation
## Hybrid Identity with AAD
- Password hash synchronization (PHS)
- Pass-through authentication (PTA)
- Federation (AD FS)

## Authentication Options
- Password hash synchronization
    - A sign-in method that **synchronizes a hash of a users on-premises AD password** with AAD.
- Pass-through authentication
    - A sign-in method that allows users to use the same password on-premises and in the cloud, but doesn't require the additional infrastructure of a federated environment.
- Federation integration
    - Federation is an optional part of AAD Connect and can be used to configure a hybrid environment using an on-premises AD FS infrastructure. It also provides AD FS management capabilities such as certificate renewal (更新) and additional AD FS server deployments.

## Single Sign-On
## Self-Service Password Reset
## Azure AD Health Overview

# 3. Implement Virtual Networking
## Azure Virtual Networking
- Communicate between Azure resources
    - Through a VNet
    - Through a VNet service endpoint
    - Through VNet Peering
    - Through Private Link
- Communicate with on-premises resources
    - Point-to-site virtual private network (P2S VPN)
    - Site-to-site VPN (S2S VPN)
    - Azure ExpressRoute (專線，台灣為是方電訊)
- Filter network traffic
    - Network Security groups (NSGs)
    - Network virtual appliances (NVA)
        - A network virtual appliance (NVA) is a VM that performs a network function, such as a firewall, WAN optimization, or other network function.
- Route network traffic
    - Route tables
    - Border gateway protocol (BGP) routes
        - If you connect your virtual network to your on-premises network using an Azure **VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute** connection, you can propagate your on-premises BGP routes to your virtual networks.

## Connect Services with Virtual Network Peering
- Configure VNet Peering

## Gateway Transit and Transitivity
## Service Chaining
## Vnet Peering vs VPN Gateway
## Considerations

# 4. Implement VMs for Windows and Linux
## Virtual Machine Sizes
## Virtual Machine Pricing
## Virtual Machine Storage
Managed disks are the newer and recommended disk storage model. Azure managed disks are block-level storage volumes that are managed by Azure and used with Azure Virtual Machines. Managed disks are like a physical disk in an on-premises server but, virtualized. With managed disks, all you have to do is specify the disk size, the disk type, and provision the disk.
