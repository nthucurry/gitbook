# Azure Function
## Logic Apps
Azure Logic Apps is a cloud service that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate (編排) tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.

Logic Apps simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions for app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) communication, whether in the cloud, on premises, or both.

## API Management
API Management (APIM) is a way to create consistent and modern API gateways for existing back-end services.

API Management helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services. Businesses everywhere are looking to extend their operations as a digital platform, creating new channels, finding new customers and driving deeper engagement with existing ones. API Management provides the core competencies (管理能力) to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement (保證), business insights, analytics, security, and protection. You can use Azure API Management to take any backend and launch a full-fledged API program based on it.

This article provides an overview of common scenarios that involve APIM. It also gives a brief overview of the APIM system's main components. The article, then, gives a more detailed overview of each component.

## Integration Service Environments (ISE)
ISE is a fully isolated and dedicated environment for all enterprise-scale integration needs. When you create a new ISE, it’s injected into your Azure Virtual Network allowing you to deploy Logic Apps as a service in your VNET.

With the general availability of the ISE, we’ve made several improvements from preview giving your Logic Apps more power when running in an ISE.

Since an ISE provides a private execution environment for executing your Logic Apps where you can take advantage of more deployed resources, many of the limits have also been increased.
