# [Learn about Conditional Access and Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/conditional-access)
Use Conditional Access with Microsoft Intune to control the devices and apps that can connect to your email and company resources. When integrated, you can gate access to keep your corporate data secure, while giving users an experience that allows them to do their best work from any device, and from any location.

# Ways to use Conditional Access with Intune
## Device-based Conditional Access
Intune and AAD work together to make sure only managed and compliant devices can access email, Microsoft 365 services, SaaS apps, and on-premises apps. Additionally, you can set a policy in AAD to enable only domain-joined computers or mobile devices that have enrolled (註冊) in Intune to access Microsoft 365 services. Including:
- Conditional Access based on network access control
- Conditional Access based on device risk
- Conditional Access for Windows PCs. Both corporate-owned and bring your own device (BYOD).
- Conditional Access for Exchange on-premises

## App-based Conditional Access
Intune and AAD work together to make sure only managed apps can access corporate e-mail or other Microsoft 365 services.
